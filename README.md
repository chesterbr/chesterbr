### Carlos Duarte Do Nascimento (aka Chester or [@chesterbr](https://github.com/chesterbr))

- 🤓 &nbsp;Professional programmer for >30 years (and hobbyist for even longer), still loving it!
- 💼 &nbsp;Worked in companies of all sizes and shapes (including GitHub itself, Shopify and my own); details [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chesterbr/).
- 🔧 &nbsp;My passion is to bring people (including myself) joy by building and fixing stuff.
- 🏝️ &nbsp;Currently on a personal leave: charging my 🔋s, improving [miniTruco](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.chester.minitruco), and studying random topics such as [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).
- 💪 &nbsp;Advocate for social justice, actively dismantling my biases one step at a time.
- 👾 &nbsp;Enjoy playing and building video games (but strongly despise the [toxic corners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_(harassment_campaign)) of the gaming world).
- 💬 &nbsp;Love comics and sequential art of nearly all types, genres, places and times (same caveat as above to the [💩-heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comicsgate)).
- 🖋 &nbsp;[Blog](https://chester.me) occasionally, usually about electronics and hardware hacks, but anything goes.
- 📺 &nbsp;"Chester" comes from [Chester McTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hamimmdHzUo), a character in the obscure [Beverly Hills Teens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Teens) ("Turma da Pesada") cartoon.
- 🇧🇷 &nbsp;Born and raised in Brazil (the "br" in [@chesterbr](https://github.com/chesterbr)).
- 🇨🇦 &nbsp;Citizen and resident of Canada.
- 🐘 These days doing social media mostly [on Mastodon/fediverse](https://ursal.zone/@chesterbr) (in multiple languages, but filtering is easy).
- 🤷‍♂️ &nbsp;Lacking ideas for a proper README.
