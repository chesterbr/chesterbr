### Carlos Duarte Do Nascimento (aka Chester or [@chesterbr](https://github.com/chesterbr))

- 🤓 &nbsp;Programmer for more than 30 years, still loving it!
- 🔧 &nbsp;Build and fix stuff to bring people joy (including myself).
- 💪 &nbsp;Social justice supporter.
- :octocat:&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently working as a software engineer @ [GitHub](https://github.com). Pouring a lot of love in a tool I admire, working alongside a great crowd (even if we [sometimes](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/9/20906605/github-ice-contract-immigration-ice-dan-friedman) respectfully disagree). Opinons here are my own, of course.
- 🖋 &nbsp;[Blog](https://chester.me) occasionally, usually about electronics and hardware hacks, but anything goes.
- 📺 &nbsp;"Chester" comes from [Chester McTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hamimmdHzUo), a character in the obscure [Beverly Hills Teens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Teens) cartoon ("Turma da Pesada" in Brazil)
- 🇧🇷 &nbsp;Born and raised in Brazil (the "br" in [@chesterbr](https://github.com/chesterbr))
- 🇨🇦 &nbsp;Citizen and resident of Canada.
- 🤷‍♂️ &nbsp;Lacking ideas for a proper README.
